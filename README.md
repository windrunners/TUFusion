# TUFusion
TUFusion is an image fusion algorithm, more precisely, a versatile or universal image fusion algorithm that can be applied across multiple domains. Currently, the algorithm has demonstrated excellent performance in areas such as infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-modal medical image fusion. Unlike other image fusion algorithms, TUFusion requires only one set of weights and models to handle multiple tasks effectively.


1. Downloading data set
Download MSCOCO as a file named "MSCOCO 2014" and place the file in the main folder, then you can train.

2. train:
Run the "train_tufusion.py" file.

3. test:
Run the "test_image.py" file.

4. Download the best models for our study
(1) Create a new folder named "models" under the main file;
(2) You can download the trained model in this article from the following link:
